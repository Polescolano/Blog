								<blockquote>How many times have you thought; this could be easier another way, or I would like to create an app but I do not know how to code... Well, you're in the right place. Let this post help you take the step of actually doing it!</blockquote>							
											

								<p>Greetings! üëã Do you want to create full solutions Application for your organization with low code, fast, sturdy and secure ?? Then follow reading and have a happy developing!üöÄ </p>
								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>Let's start with a brief introduction. What is Power Apps?</p>
								<p>Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors that lets you create custom business apps without coding (or coding a little; Excel like). It provides a rapid development environment where you can build apps according to your business needs. With Power Apps, you can build professional solutions using AI-powered development, prebuilt templates, and connectors to hundreds of data sources and systems. You can solve countless business problems with Power Apps, whether it's finance, sales and marketing, human resources, operations, or frontline workers.</p>
								<p>Power Apps can connect to data you're already using. It can provide you a front-end app to interact with your data on any device, web browsers, mobile devices and tabets.</p>
								<p>The best thing about Power Apps is that you don't need coding experience to begin using it. The interface in the Power Platform studio enables you to produce solutions that can transform your manual business processes to digital ones, and start digitizing your organization.</p>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
										<p>With Power Apps, you can:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>üë®‚Äçüíª Build an app quickly by connecting with existing data. </li>
											<li>üîó Connect to the cloud services and data sources that you're already using.</li>
											<li>üì± Share your apps instantly so that coworkers can use them on their phones and tablets.</li>
											<li>üíª Automate daily manual processes.</li>
											<li>üîã Some App exemples:
												<ul>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">Employee management</li>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">Internal Ticketing app</li>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">Invoices creation flow</li>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">Stock management</li>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">Logistics planification</li>
													<li style="list-style-type: circle; ">And a lot more, especially for internal organizations cases</li>

								<h3>Starting Power Apps - The enviroment</h3>
								<p>To get started using Power Apps, you need to sign in to your organizational Microsoft 365 Account. Then from your web browser, go to <a href="https://make.powerapps.com/">make.powerapps.com</a>. This web address takes you to the Power Apps Maker Portal where you can begin creating your app.</p>
								<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Notice a menu down the left-hand side of your screen, and a Copilot entry field in the top-center of the screen. Copilot provides a way to describe what you want your app to do in everyday language. However, I do not recommend using it if you are new here! there's an add-on cost. ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps/media/maker-portal.svg#lightbox" alt="power apps"></span></div>
								<p>To get started with building an app on any data source, you select the Create button from the left-hand menu. Power Apps gives you shortcuts to start your app from some of the most common data sources including SharePoint and Excel, both of which are included in your organizational Microsoft 365 Account.</p>
								<p>There are links to instructional videos for the most common ways to start, and if you continue to scroll down the <b>Create</b> page you see templates that are available to use. Templates are a great way to see how an app can behave with data, however, you don't want to use any of these templates with your own data. As you look through the templates, notice that some of them are Model-driven apps. Model-driven apps are form-based apps and aren't covered in this learning module. If you decide to try an app, make sure that it's a <b>Canvas app</b>.</p>
								<pre><code>üí° Canvas app allow you to create freely both in front-end design and back-end code. <br>Model-driven apps are form-based, nice for creating a quick CRM(Dynamics) add-on for exemple, <br>but it's limited.</code></pre>
								<p>In the <b>Learn</b> tab, you find links to available Microsoft training and News, Blogs, Discussion forum and a host of how-to articles and instructional videos.</p>
								<p>The <b>Apps</b> tab provides a listing of all your apps and buttons to start a new app, like the ones in the Create tab.</p>
								<p>Well then, please click on the <b>New app</b> button ‚Üí select <b>Canvas app</b> ‚Üí select name (like Test_firstApp) and Format: <b>tablet</b> ‚Üí Start!üöÄ</p>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://www.jadeglobal.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/6_0.png" alt="power apps"></span></div>
								<p>Now you're in the main Power Apps create page, üßò relax, isn't a big deal really! üòä </p>
								<p>The best way to learn how to use it is by touching it all. But let me drive you through the interface:</p>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-4 col-4-medium">
										At the left vertical bar:
										<ul>
											<li><b>Layers icon:</b> will show you the Tree view, all the elements in the app, such as a input text component, image, gallery, screens, etc.</li>
											<li><b>Plus icon:</b> will show you the list of elements you can add at the app. Go have a look.</li>
											<li><b>Database icon:</b> will show you the data connectors you have and let you add more.</li>
											<li><b>Media icon:</b> here you'll upload all the media, to later a add it to a any element.</li>
											<li><b>Configuration icon:</b> here you'll manage all the app conf.</li>							
										</ul>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-4-medium">
										At the top bar:
										<ul>
											<li><b>top right icons:</b> this area allow you to un-do/re-do, play the app (view how it would look), share the app to cooperate.</li>
											<li><b>top left options:</b> here are the tipical tool options, just check it at need.</li>
											<li><b>middle horizontal bar:</b> this for adding a new screen(check options) and the text formating options.</li>
											<li><b>bottom bar:</b> This is an important one, first; every component at the app, have this attributes(fill, onClick, color, visible, etc.) to edit and here is where the code is put. How? with the following FX text input. </li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-4-medium">
										At the right side:
										<ul>
											<li><b>Propesties:</b> Here you'll find the main components attributes, with a quick access.</li>
											<li><b>Advanced:</b> More components options.</li>
											<li><b>Ideas:</b> just play with it, spoiler alert: not commonly used.</li>						
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>

								<h3>Starting Power Apps - Developing</h3>
								<p>Let's add some data source first. The easiest and most used databases for Power Apps is <b>Sharepoint List</b> because it's  very well integrated in the microsoft enviroment, it's relational database, cloud serverless and my favorite: it's free. But if it's your first time in Power Platform, I'll share with you how to upload an <b>Excel</b> to SharePoint List, this Lists are like a database table. Please follow these easy steps: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-list-based-on-a-spreadsheet-380cfeb5-6e14-438e-988a-c2b9bea574fa">How to create a Sharepoint List from an Excel</a>.</p>
								<pre><code>üí° In case of dubt starting a new project, it's always good idea to start from the data.</code></pre>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
										Now that we have that database, let's create our 1st screen with a gallary table: 
										<ol>
											<li> Go to <b>insert</b> ‚Üí select Gallery. You'll see appeared a Lorem ipsum(sample) gallery. </li>
											<li> This gallery will ask you to <b>select the data</b> you want to show, select the Sharepoint list that you've created.</li>
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://www.eswcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-1.png" alt="power apps"></span></div>
											<li> Alright the table now is ugly, worry not:</li>
												<ol>
													<li value="31">First, know that you can move, resize and edit the design of the gallary. See the <b>Pencil icon</b>? click it, and it will activate the row edit mode, add all the elements you need, in this case: textlabel or input ‚Üí make the gallary bigger ‚Üí and try to fit horizontaly all those components, ‚Üí delete image element even, and this should be starting to look like a table. I'm sure you've observed that editing this first row, all the following rows have been edit too.  </li>
													<li value="32">Go to the right side, there you'll be able to select the components inside the gallery and select the column of your data table be showing in that component.</li>
												</ol>
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://www.eswcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4.png" alt="power apps"></span></div>
											<li> Now you have the gallary nice created, and you can continue playing with it, for exemple, selecteing the order of the data. So with the gallary selected, go to the top ‚Üí FX input text, you should see you data table name. ‚Üí Edit that text and write this:  "Sort( [database_name], [column_name], descending )" and whatch how the gallary change.</li>
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://www.eswcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/8.png" alt="power apps"></span></div>
										</ol>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>This is the very basic thing to be done in a power app, from here I highly recommend you to improve your app by searching online and looking, for exemple, to apply filters to the gallery, header, another screen with the row details, etc.</p>
								<p>Hope you had fun developing your first app!üòä </p>
